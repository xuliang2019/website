- Computed 1406 molecular descriptors for each molecular with Mordred package. Screened training data with Pearson
  correlation and Lasso Regression methods, from 1406 descriptors to 13 descriptors, 13 descriptors to 5 descriptors, respectively.
- Utilized the best 5 properties to train models. Tried random forest, multiple linear, polynomial and neural network
  models, and found the first model is best by comparing each model R square value.
- Wrapped the model with Python files and made them into a Python module.
