- Cooperated with PNNL research scientists on a Deep Learning project;
- Screened molecules that only contain C,H,O,N,P,S elements, confined the length of each molecule to be 20.
- Classified training data according to chemical reaction types, encoded them into a latent space with a VAE model
  trained by Ryan and Sean. Calculated the average intermediate vectors with vector arithmetic method.
- Transformed inputted data into vectors, applied the average intermediate vectors to the inputs. Decoded the resulting
  vectors into molecules as prediction results. Optimized the VAE model by increasing training data size and adjusting
  Beam_search parameter.
